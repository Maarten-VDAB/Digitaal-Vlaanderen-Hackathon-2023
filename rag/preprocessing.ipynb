       "'Question: Difference between sectoral mediation and intensive services? \\n Answer: Is the distance to the labor market. Sectoral mediation is done towards the NEC (normal economic circuit). For customers in intensive services, the distance to the NEC is - for the time being - too great. Question: Where to dispatch when in doubt between sectoral and intensive? \\n Answer: Always to a sectoral mediation team. Question: Who dispatches to intensive services? \\n Answer: Dutch-speaking customers who meet at least 1 of the following conditions: With a certificate BUSO OV2 (cat. 03, 05 or 00). With a NIHDI status without mediator in cat.32 ( not for cat.03 ) Customer with income replacement allowance FPS Social Security (cat. 06) In cat.05 who need help from VDAB. See paragraph: \\' When cat. 05 dispatch? They want to work in the social economy. With a request for an activation process or a work / care trajectory. They indicate that the search for work is difficult because of: Serious health problems (age does not play a role, can also be for people over 55). Reintegration after a long period of inactivity. Various problems in other areas of life (housing, money, relationships,...). Of which you notice that the thresholds and restrictions are too great. Tips for estimating this: Start from the competencies of the customer, not from the limitations. Link the competencies to the labor market, focus here too on opportunities instead of limitations. For example, a customer with an arm or back problems can go to NEC with extra help. Only zoom in on thresholds and restrictions when the mediation conversation gets stuck. Attention: Never dispatch a Brussels wz to IDV or IDVA. Brussels does not have an IDV or IDVA cluster. Dispatch a Brussels wz to another cluster. The following message therefore appears at the Vilvoorde, Halle and Asse locations: \"No WZ with domicile in Brussels dispatching! Brussels WZ dispatching to sectoral services (Brussels has no IDV and IDV Non-native speakers)\" Question: Who dispatches to intensive services for non-native speakers? \\n Answer: Foreign-speaking customers who meet at least 1 of the following conditions: registered in cat. 00 or cat. 03 and ask for mediation to work on the recommendation of the \\'Agency for Integration and Civic Integration\\'. In the MLB file of these customers, a label \"active integration process\" will appear in the banner from 11 12 2021. meet one of the conditions from the paragraph: \"Who dispatches to intensive service?\" an interview is not possible and there is no recent work experience. See Customer does not speak French or English > No common contact language. Attention: Never dispatch a Brussels wz to IDV or IDVA. Brussels does not have an IDV or IDVA cluster. Dispatch a Brussels wz to another cluster. The following message therefore appears at the Vilvoorde, Halle and Asse locations: \"No WZ with domicile in Brussels dispatching! Brussels WZ dispatching to sectoral services (Brussels has no IDV and IDV Non-native speakers)\" Question: Send the customer well prepared for an interview at IDV \\n Answer: Advise the customer to bring as many supporting documents as possible. For example: Supporting documents that prove the work disability such as medical certificates, statements from the school or CLB, reports from the Flemish Agency for Persons with Disabilities (VAPH). A written statement in which the attending physician states what the condition is (medical, psychological,..) and what the prognosis is. Refer the customer to www.vdab.be/arbeidshandicap to print the type form. Or send the form by mail to less web-minded customers. Question: What services do the teams provide IDV? \\n Answer: Analysis of the problems that make the distance to the labor market too great for the customer and help in addressing them. For example: medical problems, psychological problems, problems in other areas of life such as housing, money, relationships. Intensive coaching with specialized knowledge of the above problems. Specialized workplace learning. Integrated trajectories in close cooperation with partners in other areas of life. Such as welfare & care, treatment & rehabilitation. Help in finding tailor-made work. Intensive guidance on the work floor. ... Question: What mediation do sectoral teams provide? \\n Answer: Mediation-oriented actions towards the normal economic circuit (NEC), such as: Matchings Application Coaching Vocational training Support and feedback when applying for a job. Professional orientation. Information on training and work-based learning. Help in removing practical barriers. For example, in the field of childcare and mobility. ... Question: Which six clusters offer sectoral mediation? \\n Answer: There are six clusters that offer sectoral mediation. They are divided into sectoral teams: Cluster Construction and Wood Teams sectoral mediation Construction and Wood Cluster Transport and Logistics Teams sectoral mediation Transport and Logistics Cluster Services to persons Teams sectoral mediation Hospitality Teams sectoral mediation Cleaning Teams sectoral mediation other services (except catering and cleaning) Cluster Industry Teams sectoral mediation industry Cluster Business support,  Retail & ICT Teams sectoral mediation Business support Teams sectoral mediation ICT Teams sectoral mediation Retail Cluster Care & Education Teams sectoral mediation Care Teams sectoral mediation Education Question: Which clusters offer intensive services? \\n Answer: There is only one intensive cluster. This is divided into two types of teams: Teams IDV. Teams IDV to non-native speakers. Question: Which channel to choose for dispatch by sector Other services (except catering and cleaning)? \\n Answer: Artworker: telephone lock See Artists Other: conversation on location The legislation for artists is specialist work. That is why we book a telephone lock for them. For the other professions, we opt for an on-site interview. After all, VDAB wants start-up conversations to take place on location as much as possible, and only exceptionally by telephone.  See also Color chart .'"

      "Question answer pairs of the document: Question: IBO premium is a compensation for the \n",
      " Answer: training effort that the student makes. is a fixed monthly amount. is not calculated on the basis of future wages. is also paid for days on which the student is absent. is settled pro rata according to the loss of employment in the event of lower performance (part-time IBO). Question: Calculation of IBO premium The IBO \n",
      " Answer: mediator checks in the IBO tool what income the prospective student has at the start of the IBO: unemployment benefit other income (living wage, invalidity benefit, severance pay, part-time wage, pension, benefit from another country) no income This means that when the jobseeker receives a benefit/income, the IBO premium is added to this. Translated into cents: Unemployment benefit: student receives at least EUR 1,564.02 gross (unemployment benefit + IBO premium - 01-12-2022) Does the WZ know the daily amount of his unemployment benefit? Then you can use the detailed calculation (intranet) to know how much the IBO premium will be. Other income: student receives approximately EUR 391.01 gross (= 20% of the GGMMI - 01-12-2022) No income: student receives approximately EUR 1,564.02 gross (= 80% of the GGMMI - 01-12-2022) GGMMI = Guaranteed Average Minimum Monthly Income Tip Do you want an idea of the net amount? Then reduce the gross amount by 11.11% withholding tax. Please note that there are some special cases (intranet) that can have an impact on the IBO premium. Question: Other income: living wage \n",
      " Answer: The IBO premium affects the living wage. This can be reduced or even suspended. Ordinary IBO: the living wage can possibly be fully combined with the IBO premium for 6 months. IBO-plus: the OCMW can reduce the living wage because the employer does not pay anything for the IBO. Attention: In cases where the CPAS does not allow cumulation, the IBO mediator requests a written statement from the CPAS that they suspend the right to living wages. Only then can an IBO mediator change the category to \"no benefit\". Background information The employer does not pay directly to the student and there is no direct link between the employer's invoice and the IBO premium that the student receives. And yet, through its legislation, the CPAS continues to rely on the employer's contribution to determine whether the IBO can take place and whether living wages are still paid. Question: Secondary occupation: other income or unemployment benefit? \n",
      " Answer: Does someone who has income from a secondary occupation also receive unemployment benefits? Then you use the category unemployment benefit. Does someone with income from a secondary occupation not have unemployment benefits? Then you indicate the category \"other\". Question: Free of charge for the \n",
      " Answer: IBO student All courses recognized by VDAB must be free of charge for students, including IBO students. That is why VDAB pays the travel allowance and childcare allowance. The fees are recorded by the mediator in the IBO tool. All conditions and guidelines regarding these allowances can be found in the knowledge system: Flat-rate travel allowance for students Line subscription for students Reimbursement for childcare for students Question: What does a young person get in vocational integration time? \n",
      " Answer: 80% of the GGMMI The young person has no income in addition to the right to the growth package or child benefit. See FAQ Calculation IBO premium Question: How much is the IBO premium for a part-time IBO? \n",
      " Answer: The fixed monthly amount (IBO premium) is settled pro rata according to the breach of employment. The SL cannot give concrete amounts about this. Question: IBO premium if situation changes \n",
      " Answer: The student informs the IBO mediator. The IBO mediator registers the new situation in the PVC tool. The IBO premium is recalculated. .vb. student becomes entitled to benefit during the IBO. Question: Earnings in a severance payment? \n",
      " Answer: As long as the customer receives the termination fee: other income. As soon as he no longer receives severance pay: no income or unemployment benefit. Question: Combining an IBO with an additional job \n",
      " Answer: The additional job means a different income. See FAQ Calculation IBO premium The customer only has to report this to his payout institution when he is entitled to additional payment. Procedure Service Line Refer the customer to his payout institution or his IBO mediator. Question: Who pays the student? \n",
      " Answer: VDAB pays IBO premium Flat-rate travel allowance for students Line season ticket for students if necessary.  Reimbursement for childcare for students Internal info All IBOs at/via VDAB are paid by VDAB, regardless of place of residence or place of employment. Question: When is the student paid? \n",

      " Answer: Yes Background information The IBO premium is not based on performance but on the calendar days included in the IBO contract. It does not matter whether this is a public holiday, weekend day, weekday or day absence. Question: Is the student reimbursed on days of illness, leave, small leave during the IBO? \n",
      " Answer: Yes Background information The IBO premium is not based on performance but on the calendar days included in the IBO contract. It does not matter whether this is a public holiday, weekend day, weekday or day absence. Attention: Small leave only exists for employees (e.g. birth leave, marriage, death, etc.). An IBO student is therefore not entitled to this. The situations that entitle employees to a small leave of absence are also justified situations for VDAB that allow the absence of the student. Question: Is the student compensated in the event of temporary unemployment in the company? \n",
      " Answer: Yes Background information The IBO premium is not based on performance but on the calendar days included in the IBO contract. It does not matter whether this is a public holiday, weekend day, weekday or day absence. Question: How is the shift system settled? \n",
      " Answer: A shift system does not affect the IBO premium. Question: Who bears the costs of work material (e.g. professional clothing)? \n",
      " Answer: Professional clothing and other work materials are at the expense of the employer. VDAB assumes that the employer is responsible for providing the resources necessary for the implementation of the training plan. However, this is not literally included in the IBO contract. Attention: The term work material does not include a car, e.g. with an IBO as a representative, a car is not work material for the account of the employer. Moreover, an IBO student is not allowed to go on the job alone during the IBO because there is no training. Question: Does the student receive travel costs? \n",
      " Answer: Yes, VDAB pays the travel costs as for other trainees. see Flat-rate travel allowance for students Line season ticket for students Question: Can the employer pay the IBO student extras, e.g. meal vouchers, mobile phone, company car, ...? \n",
      " Answer: No, this is not possible within IBO! see Are extra-legal benefits possible during the IBO? Please note that NSSO may consider this as an employment contract with eg. as a result, the student must repay his unemployment benefit or the employer must pay the costs associated with ordinary employment. Question: Does an IBO student receive holiday pay, end-of-year bonus or guaranteed salary in case of illness? \n",
      " Answer: No There are no social security deductions, because an IBO student is not an employee. As a result, no holiday pay or end-of-year bonus is paid and the student is not entitled to guaranteed wages in the event of illness, such as employees. Question: If you follow an IBO, will your RVA benefit drop or not? \n",
      " Answer: VDAB cannot comment on this. Procedure Service line Refer the student to his union or to the RVA. Question: What if a job seeker becomes entitled to benefits during the IBO? \n",
      " Answer: Procedure Service line The customer requests registration in cat. 00 or correction. Provide a registration certificate and chronological overview as proof of registration. Do not register with cat. 00 or don't ask for correction. see Check: The sanction > What should the job seeker do if the sanction ends during an IBO? Background information > To apply for benefits, the jobseeker needs a registration certificate in an active category. Cat wz 85 is an active category so we don't do a correction. > The IBO premium can be recalculated during the IBO. .vb. The customer starts the IBO with a suspension at RVA but receives payment again during the IBO. Question: What if the job seeker moves outside Belgium? \n",
      " Answer: A Belgian with an official address outside Belgium is considered an EU citizen. If the student receives a benefit abroad, you indicate \"other income\". If the student has no income, he or she will fill in a declaration of honour. You indicate \"no income\". see IBO for non-Belgians (intranet) Question: Can the IBO premium be cumulated with growth package or child benefit? \n",
      " Answer: Yes Neither the growth package nor the IBO premium is considered income and can therefore be combined. Question: Is the income from an IBO taxable? \n",
      " Answer: Yes, the IBO premium is taxable. Withholding tax (11.11%) is deducted.  Background information There are no social security deductions, because the student is not an employee. Every month, the student receives a payment overview. Question: There is an error on the 'individual account 281.10', what now? \n",
      " Answer: Errors on the individual account 281.10 report to the colleagues of the IBO administration via the e-mail address vergoedingen@vdab.be. Attention On the individual account, the boxes about the family status are not filled in. This is not an error. For spouse, number of children, civil status, etc., x or 0 is stated because VDAB does not have the latest data on the family status of the IBO student. The IBO student must communicate the correct family status when completing the tax return. Question: Are there any fees for home learning? \n",
      " Answer: No, VDAB does not pay travel allowance for home learning days. There is no reimbursement for any additional costs (heating, internet connection, ...) for the days of learning at home. The employer provides the resources necessary for home learning (e.g. computer). The student may only use these resources for learning purposes and not for private use. see IBO - Learning at home during IBO (intranet)\n"

      " Answer: In the banner at the top of the customer file. Note: If Actively available, nothing will appear in the banner. Question: In which files does the availability not appear 1 day after registration? \n",
      " Answer: In files of SWT employees. Here, the availability will appear in the file at the latest 2 to 3 months after registration. Why? Job seekers apply for SWT via the payout institution. The payment institution submits the application to the RVA. RVA approves or disapproves of this. Only then can the decision of the RVA go along with the data flow to VDAB. Is this a problem? No, we treat the job seekers as actively available until we see the information in the file (available in an adapted way). Question: According to wz, the availability in his file is wrong? \n",
      " Answer: Procedure Service Line Refer wz to RVA or its UI.   Background information VDAB cannot adjust availability manually. We get this through the data flow of RVA that runs daily. Question: What types of availability are there? \n",
      " Answer: Active availability Custom availability Passive availability Exemption from availability A mediator does not need to know the criteria to calculate/estimate to which availability the wz belongs. VDAB receives this via the data stream of RVA. Question: What does the 55+ person receive when registering as a job seeker? \n",
      " Answer: A start communication one day after registration, by mail or post. There is a separate start communication for this: Wz between 55 and 60 years old is in CS receives AO's receives a regular start communication, but with the message: 'If SWT, assignments are not mandatory.' 'Call us immediately to make an appointment.' Wz older than 60 years is not in CS, there is an outbound 60+ does not receive AOs, but tips receives an adapted start communication with the message: You will be contacted within 2 weeks For more information about the start communication, see: Communication plan - Communication to job seekers Question: Who receives the starting communication? \n",
      " Answer: The newly recruited job seeker. For this, VDAB looks at the date of registration (max 4 months in the past). This date changes when wz (re)registers (i.e. from a passive cat. to 00). For example, Someone registers as a cat. 03 and 2 months later as cat. 00. Then the date of registration is 2 months ago, but the change of category happened recently.

Dispatch the job seeker.  See: CS: Action-oriented (re)assessment (AGI) with DiWi With low media literacy (= little knowledge of self-management tools) there is the basic module 'Working with VDAB tools' at the trade union Register the job seeker for this training.

Be sure to write everything down in the Note. Question: 55+ and a tax benefit via a group insurance \n",
      " Answer: A wz can get an advantageous tax percentage on the group insurance. For this, he must be available for the labor market and therefore registered with VDAB with cat. 00. A registration in cat. 03 is not enough. A wz with exemption from availability is not entitled to this benefit, because it is not available.
